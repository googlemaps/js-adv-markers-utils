# Advanced Markers Utils â€“ Marker Playground

This directory contains a simple playground application for the marker API.

## Get Started

1.  Change into the playground-folder and install dependencies:

        cd examples/playground
        npm install

2.  [Create an API-key][gmp_create_apikey] for the Google Maps API.
3.  create a file `.env` with the API key in the following format:

    GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="<INSERT API KEY HERE>"

4.  start the development server:

    npm start

5.  open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

[gmp_create_apikey]: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key#create-api-keys

## Overview

The playground is a side-by-side view of a google map with a monaco editor (the
editor-component of VSCode) where typescript code using the new
marker-API can be written and executed to get a feel for the api and test
different usage-scenarios in a fast way. The contents of the editor can be
serialized into the URL for sharing.

Compiling the typescript from the editor happens in a worker via the typescript-support
already built into the monaco-editor. For execution, a wrapper emulates the
common.js environment to allow importing a predefined set of modules. External
modules can only be imported using async imports from urls.

## Code Organization

- `/`: contains `index.html` and configuration-files
- `/src`: the typescript source-root. The application entrypoint is in `main.ts`
- `/src/code-samples`: contains the source-files for all examples. The
  typescript files here should all follow the conventions for examples below.

## Writing examples

- examples have to be written as typescript files in the `./src/code-samples`-directory
- each example should demonstrate a single aspect of the library in a
  concise way - try to remove 'noise', that is code for unrelated aspects,
  as much as possible, embrace duplication
- the example must import components from the marker-library using regular
  imports (e.g. `import {Marker} from '@googlemaps/adv-markers-utils';`).
- there has to be a default export, which will be called with the
  map-instance as parameter when the script is run
- When any changes are done in the browser environment (event-listeners,
  timeouts, intervals, ...), the exported function has to return a cleanup
  function removing all those. For convenience, this does not apply for
  created markers and marker-collections, those are automatically removed
  from the map when a new version of the script is executed.

## scripts, npm-tasks and deployment

The following supporting scripts and tasks are available:

- `npm start`: starts the vite dev-server
- `npm run build`: runs all `build:*` tasks followed by `vite build` to
  generate the full application in `./dist`
- `npm run preview`: runs the full build and starts the vite preview server
  to review everything as if it were in production
