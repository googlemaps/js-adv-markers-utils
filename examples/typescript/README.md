# Advanced Markers Utils â€“ TypeScript / vite Example

This directory contains a minimal example application built with typescript/vite.

To run these examples, you need [a Google Maps API Key][gmp_apikey]. change into the `./examples/typescript`-directory and run

    npm install
    npm start

This will start the vite development-server, and print the URL to the console (typically http://localhost:5173/).
When opening the site, it will ask for the Google Maps API Key.
